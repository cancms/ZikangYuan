The FALCON system developed by Prof. Shen's team at HKUST proposes a “coverage-path-guided” autonomous exploration strategy to prevent UAVs from repeatedly visiting the same areas during exploration. However, this approach currently relies on occupancy grid map representation, which limits its applicability to large-scale exploration scenarios. This project aims to develop a point-cloud-based implementation of the coverage-path-guided exploration framework to enable scalable operations in large environments.
